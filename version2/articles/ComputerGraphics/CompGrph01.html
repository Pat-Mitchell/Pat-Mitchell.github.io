      <p>Computer graphics is a topic I found by complete accident. During lunch
      breaks at work, I'd typically go on the company computer and start
      programming whatever came to mind to pass the time. I had started
      programming a few games using the HTML &#60;canvas&#62; element and
      started looking up various game development videos on YouTube.</p>

      <p>Quaternions, quaternions, quaternions! It was a very frequent topic
      in most videos and I had never heard of it before. I learned that it was
      a topic in linear algebra at some point and decided that I had to teach it
      to myself so I could have more fun during lunch breaks.</p>

      <p>I grabbed a copy of No Bullshit Guide to Linear Algebra by Ivan Savov
      and went to work. I highly suggest the book. Not only does it cover linear
      algebra, but the final chapters of the book are devoted to various applications
      like computer graphics, quantum mechanics, probability theory, and
      cryptography. It's like a gateway to a whole bunch of projects for this
      portfolio and an endless number of ways to spend lunch breaks coding on the
      company computer.</p>

      <p>Thanks to that book, I had graduated my plans from simple 2D graphics to
      3D graphics since the transition was almost as easy as adding a value
      for the Z Coordinate.</p>
