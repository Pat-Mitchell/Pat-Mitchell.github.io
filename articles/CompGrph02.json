    <figcaption>Drawing of a house using &#60;canvas&#62; methods.</figcaption>

  <p>Above are three examples of how I spent my lunch breaks with
  the &#60;canvas&#62;. The house is drawn using built in tools for
  the canvas's 2d context. The red triangle is drawn using my library's
  fillTriangle method. The cube makes use of my matrix library to
  transform the vertices of a mesh and a z-buffer so triangles are
  drawn correctly.</p>
