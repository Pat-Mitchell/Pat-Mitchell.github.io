      <p>This project is based on a post from an old defunct forum
         that I was a part of. Basically, someone wrote a blog post about how
         they weren't hired for a job despite having an amazing and fantastic
         project to show off on his or her website. The blog post was linked
         in the forum and, naturally, the programming nerds laughed and boasted
         their own programming prowess.</p>

      <p>From what I remember, it was a turn based fighting game
         where the user is given three choices: attack, defend, and do nothing
         and then the computer opponent would attack the player, some text
         would appear on the screen, player and computer health values would
         update, and game repeats like that until someone's health is
         less than or equal to zero.</p>

      <p>It's a really simple system that does show off some programming
         ability, but it seems far from impressive.</p>

      <p>From a gameplay perspective, the player's only real choice would
         be to attack since defending either blocked all incoming damage
         or reduced it and doing nothing meant the player takes the most
         possible damage. The only choice that brings the player closer to
         their victory condition is to attack.</p>

      <p>From a technical perspective, it's just a looping bit of
         code that breaks when someone is at zero health. It's the
         same premise as pokemon's battle system, but without graphics,
         animation, music, and conditions that add more complexity than
         just attack.</p>

      <p>I figured that I should add this game to my portfolio while I'm
         thinking about it, so that I could be overlooked for a hire as well.
         Or rather, add it to my portfolio and add several features to make
         it more impressive.</p>
