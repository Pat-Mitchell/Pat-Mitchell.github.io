      <p>My memory might be a bit shaky since I did see it
         years ago and that old forum has been gone for years, but I've
         captured the ghist of the original work.</p>

      <a href="versions\version01.html" target="_blank"><p class="linkToGame">Link to game</p></a>

      <p>I've attempted to change nothing. The only way to win
         is to keep hitting the attack button, defending just prolongs
         defeat, and doing nothing is an option. I think my text in
         the "battle log" is unique with the "and falls over dead"
         message when either side loses. I can't remember if the result
         of the fight was a browser alert or if there was text appearing
         on the screen.</p>

      <p>I'm pretty sure the odds of the player winning are
         heavily stacked in his or her favor. The damage values are much
         greater for the player (3 to 10) than the bear (2 to 7) as well
         as the ten health point difference. I'm assuming the original
         developer just wanted to win more often, but it could also be a
         clever tactic to leave a good impression.</p>

      <p>There's physiological warfare going on here! Well, not
         warfare, but I'm assuming that your chances of getting hired
         are higher if you force a win rather than let the interviewer
         lose.</p>
