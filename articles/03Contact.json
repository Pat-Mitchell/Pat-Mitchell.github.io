  <p>Please only use my email for potential job offers and questions pertaining
  projects. As of August 23, 2022, I'm well aware of a lot of issues with
  the projects. I've been rushing to add them to the portfolio for about three
  weeks, learning how to make a website portfolio, and working on another project
  on the side.</p>
