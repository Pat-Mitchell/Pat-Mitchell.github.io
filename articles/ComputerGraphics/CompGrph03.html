      <p>WebGL (Web Graphics Library) is the next step in learning computer
      graphics. It is still possible to continue learning with the &#60;canvas&#62;'s
      2D context, however there's a major bottleneck in performance when using only
      the CPU for drawing to the screen. Per-pixel manipulation is very slow and
      "creative" solutions are required to improve performance like using multiple
      &#60;canvas&#62; elements for static elements like ui and predrawing scrolling
      backgrounds.</p>

      <p>WebGL offloads the work from the CPU to the GPU and the API decreases
      developer time (which is at a very high premium when some projects are
      almost exclusively worked on during lunch breaks). There's also additional
      marketing benefits for myself having experience with GLSL (OpenGL Shading
      Language), which is used in both WebGL and OpenGL applications.</p>

      <p>To learn how to use the webGL context, I picked up a copy of WebGL
      Programming Guide by Kouichi Matsuda and Podger Lea. The examples I have
      on this page are derived from the book. Some changes were made to the
      example code from the book because it was first written in 2013 and
      Javascript has gotten several updates since. For example the keyword "let"
      replaces most instances of "var" when defining variables because "var" defines
      globally and creates a high risk of name collision.</p>

      <p>Figure 1 displays the "Hello, World!" of WebGL. Drawing a point to the
      screen is a fantastic first program to begin with for understanding how to
      initialize a &#60;canvas&#62; with WebGL and learning the basics of the
      vertex and fragment shaders.</p>

        <figcaption style="position: relative; top: 30px;">Figure 2: Rotating triangle with buttons.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Figure 2 displays a colorful rotating triangle who's position and rotation
      speed can be adjusted by the user using the buttons uder the figure. Using
      the GLSL shader programming language makes shading a lot faster and easier.
      I had originally impleted vertex based shading in my 2D contex computer graphics
      engine. However, I felt that interpolating the color of each fragment using
      barycentric coordinates would have impacted performance too much and settled
      for a flat shader where each tri had a single color instead of each vertex.</p>

      <p>Figure 2 also doesn't appear in the WebGL book exactly as shown here. The
      original example is a spinning red triangle instead of a multi-colored one.
      I felt it necessary to combine concepts taught in multiple chapters to
      show that I can do more than just copy straight from the book. The book example
      is just an equilateral solid red triangle while this one is varies the color
      based on where the fragment is in relation to the vertices and positions of the
      vertices are scaled 150% in the x direction and 75% in the y direction.</p>

      <figure id="figure3" style="float: left; margin:0 1rem 1rem 0.5rem; text-align:center;">
        <canvas id="webgl3" width="300" height="300" style="height: 15rem; width: 15rem;"></canvas>
        <figcaption>Figure 3: Click and draggable lighted cube.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Figure 3 displays another interactive canvas with a textured cube and
      in directional lighting. The rgb values of the light are being controled
      by three sinusoid functions out of phase with eachother by 2/3 Pi. It's
      another modified example from the book. The original example was only about
      putting a texture on a model and how GLSL uses a separate coodinate system
      for texels. The lighting was taken from another chapter where the examples
      were only single colored cubes or a sphere.</p>

      <p>The changing light was just a curiousity. The book did not go over shaping
      functions for shading. There was one early example of linear shading based on
      the fragment's x and y values on the canvas, but that was to show off WebGL's
      coordinate system. Sinusoidal functions seemed easy enough to implement to
      change the color over time. Each rgb value is out of phase with the other
      two by &#177;2/3 Pi so there's always at least one color on at any time and
      any rgb negative rgb value is read as 0.0.</p>

      <figure id="figure4" style="float: right; margin:0 1rem 1rem 0.5rem; text-align:center;">
        <canvas id="webgl4" width="300" height="300" style="height:10rem;width:10rem;"></canvas>
        <figcaption>Figure 4: Cube in fog.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Figure 4 is an example from the book used to demonstrate visual effects that
      can be created with shaders. The "fog factor" is controled by a linear
      equation that starts at 1.0 (no frament is obscured) to 0.0 (completely obscured).
      The linear equation "starts" at some distance from the eye. Until then, there
      is no obscurity. The user can control the start distance with the up and down
      arrow keys.</p>
