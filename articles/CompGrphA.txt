<h2>Linear Algebra</h2>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>&emsp;While reading Prime Obsession: Bernhard Riemann and the Greatest
   Unsolved Problem in Mathematics by John Derbyshire, I noticed that
   quaternions were a frequently mentioned topic and I had
   no prior knowledge of what they were. I could only surmise that
   it was an import topic for mathematics and I wanted to know what
   they were.</p>
<p>&emsp;A little research led to linear algebra and then Ivan Savov's
   No Bullshit Guide to Linear Algebra. It's an excellent book on the
   subject that's easy to digest and intended for the more casual
   audience. The last few chapters of the book are dedicated to
   applications of linear algebra like quantum mechanics, probability
   theory, and computer graphics.</p>
<h3>Quaternions</h3>
<p>&emsp;Quaternions are complex numbers composed of vector (imaginary) and
   scalar (real) component and are used to represent either a direction
   or point in 3d and 2d space. They are expressed as:</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;<b>v</b>=(x,y,w)</p>
<p>Where the w component is the real part typically holding the
   value of 0 for a direction and 1 for a position in space. A quaternion
   used in 3d space is then represented as:</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;<b>v</b>=(x,y,z,w)</p>
<h3>Transform Matrices</h3>
<p>&emsp;A subset of matrices that are extremely helpful form
   for computer graphics because of their ability to combine
   multiple transformations in a single matrix which increases
   readability and execution time of code. Transform matrices
   are 3x3 Matrices for 2d exclusive graphics and 4x4 for 3d
   and appear like so:</p>
