    <h2>Basic Scene</h2>
    <p>This is the first webGL project I made that made use of GLSL shaders.
    </p>
    <p>From the top left, the color data is stored at each vertex and it's interpolated 
      across the rest of the face and mixes with the color of the other vertices.
    </p>
    <p>The next cube is a single color without any shading. The first cube doesn't
      have lighting or shadows either. The single color of the second cube exagerates it.
    </p>
    <p>The next two cubes have basic ambient and directional lighting. The shape of the red
      cube becomes more obvious compared to the unshaded version and the fourth cube is given
      a different color on each face.     
    </p>
    <p>Unlike most tutorials and lessons in books, there's more than one object and more than
      one shader in this scene. A difficulty faced in making this demo was making shaders 
      separate from each cube to lower memory usage. That way, many cube instances can be
      instantiated without needing to create a unique shader for each one.
