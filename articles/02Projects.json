  <p>Welcome the projects that I've been making specifically for this site.
  The website, in and of itself, counts as one. All the HTML, CSS, and javascript
  for this site is all typed up by myself. I've used actual blogs as references
  for making this site and browsed another online resource to find matching
  colors. Otherwise, site navigation would be "unique" and you might think
  I was colorblind.</p>`,
