  title:`Comicbook Collection Tracker - Introduction`,
  body:`
  <p>I enjoy collecting individual issues of comics, but it eventually
  becomes necessary to track the comics in my collection. I've accidentally
  bought comics I already own and skipped issues I thought I had. The problem
  is further compounded while buying multiple issues on eBay where I don't
  have complete control of which issues I will get and nature of the limited
  time offers doesn't afford me the greatest luxury.</p>
