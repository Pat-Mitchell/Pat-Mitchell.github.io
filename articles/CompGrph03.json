  body:`
  <p>WebGL (Web Graphics Library) is the next step in learning computer
  graphics. It is still possible to continue learning with the &#60;canvas&#62;'s
  2D context, however there's a major bottleneck in performance when using only
  the CPU for drawing to the screen. Per-pixel manipulation is very slow and
  "creative" solutions are required to improve performance like using multiple
  &#60;canvas&#62; elements for static elements like ui and predrawing scrolling
  backgrounds.</p>

  <p>WebGL offloads the work from the CPU to the GPU and the API decreases
  developer time (which is at a very high premium when some projects are
  almost exclusively worked on during lunch breaks). There's also additional
  marketing benefits for myself having experience with GLSL (OpenGL Shading
  Language), which is used in both WebGL and OpenGL applications.</p>
