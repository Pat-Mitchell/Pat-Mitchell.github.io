  title:`Adding More Combat Options`,
  body:`
  <p>The combat options in the original were very bare, so
     it's time to add depth. A lot of depth.</p>

  <a href="2_1-Recreation.html"><p class="linkToGame">Link to game</p></a>     

  <p>I'm implemented a portion of the combat
     system from the tabletop rpg game, GURPS. The system has the player
     choose between five different combat maneuvers that lead to five
     different ways to attack and six different ways to defend. Also,
     "Do nothing" is still an option.</p>

  <p>Since that is a lot of information to take in, there are
     tooltips available to the user. The user can learn about the system's
     use of three six sided dice (hereby refered to as 3d6) to determine
     the outcome of a skill roll and what each of the combat maneuvers
     mean and how they effect combat.</p>

  <p>In addition to the combat, the player and opponent have
     stats and skills like in the actual tabletop game. Most of these
     aren't relevant to combat, however they are a part of the full game.</p>
