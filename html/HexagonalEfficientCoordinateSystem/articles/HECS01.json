  body:`
  <p>The Hexagonal Efficient Coordinate System (HECS) is a coordinate system
  for hexagonal grids that allows hexagonally sampled images to be efficiently
  stored and processed on digital systems. My inspiration for delving into
  this topic is fueled by various games like GURPS and Heroes of Might and Magic
  that use hexagonal grids for the movement of game pieces and a youtube video
  published by user CGPGrey about hexagons being the best regular polygon that
  tiles the grid.</p>
