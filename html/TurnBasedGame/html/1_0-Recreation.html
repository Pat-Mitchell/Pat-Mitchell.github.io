    <h2>Recreation</h2>
    <p><a href="1_1-Recreation.html">I've recreated the game
       to the best of my ability.</a></p>
    <p>&emsp;My memory might be a bit shaky since I did see it
       years ago and that old forum has been gone for years, but I've
       captured the ghist of the original work.</p>
    <p>&emsp;I've attempted to change nothing. The only way to win
       is to keep hitting the attack button, defending just prolongs
       defeat, and doing nothing is an option. I think my text in
       the "battle log" is unique with the "and falls over dead"
       message when either side loses. I can't remember if the result
       of the fight was a browser alert or if there was text appearing
       on the screen.</p>
    <p>&emsp;I'm pretty sure the odds of the player winning are
       heavily stacked in his or her favor. The damage values are much
       greater for the player (3 to 10) than the bear (2 to 7) as well
       as the ten health point difference. I'm assuming the original
       developer just wanted to win more often, but it could also be a
       clever tactic to leave a good impression.</p>
    <p>&emsp;There's physiological warfare going on here! Well, not
       warfare, but I'm assuming that your chances of getting hired
       are higher if you force a win rather than let the interviewer
       lose.</p>
