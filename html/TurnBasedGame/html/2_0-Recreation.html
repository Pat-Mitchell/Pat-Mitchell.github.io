    <h2>More Combat Options</h2>
    <p><a href="2_1-Recreation.html">Link to game</a></p>
    <p>&emsp;The combat options in the original were very bare, so
       it's time to add depth. A lot of depth.</p>
    <p>&emsp;I'm implemented a portion of the combat
       system from the tabletop rpg game, GURPS. The system has the player
       choose between five different combat maneuvers that lead to five
       different ways to attack and six different ways to defend. Also,
       "Do nothing" is still an option.</p>
    <p>&emsp;Since that is a lot of information to take in, there are
       tooltips available to the user. The user can learn about the system's
       use of three six sided dice (hereby refered to as 3d6) to determine
       the outcome of a skill roll and what each of the combat maneuvers
       mean and how they effect combat.</p>
    <p>&emsp;In addition to the combat, the player and opponent have
       stats and skills like in the actual tabletop game. Most of these
       aren't relevant to combat, however they are a part of the full game.</p>
