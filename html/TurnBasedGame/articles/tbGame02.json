  <p>My memory might be a bit shaky since I did see it
     years ago and that old forum has been gone for years, but I've
     captured the ghist of the original work.</p>

  <p>I've attempted to change nothing. The only way to win
     is to keep hitting the attack button, defending just prolongs
     defeat, and doing nothing is an option. I think my text in
     the "battle log" is unique with the "and falls over dead"
     message when either side loses. I can't remember if the result
     of the fight was a browser alert or if there was text appearing
     on the screen.</p>

  <p>I'm pretty sure the odds of the player winning are
     heavily stacked in his or her favor. The damage values are much
     greater for the player (3 to 10) than the bear (2 to 7) as well
     as the ten health point difference. I'm assuming the original
     developer just wanted to win more often, but it could also be a
     clever tactic to leave a good impression.</p>

  <p>There's physiological warfare going on here! Well, not
     warfare, but I'm assuming that your chances of getting hired
     are higher if you force a win rather than let the interviewer
     lose.</p>
