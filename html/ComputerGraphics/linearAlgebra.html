    <h2>Linear Algebra</h2>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>&emsp;While reading Prime Obsession: Bernhard Riemann and the Greatest
       Unsolved Problem in Mathematics by John Derbyshire, I noticed that
       quaternions were a frequently mentioned topic and I had
       no prior knowledge of what they were. I could only surmise that
       it was an import topic for mathematics and I wanted to know what
       they were.</p>
    <p>&emsp;A little research led to linear algebra and then Ivan Savov's
       No Bullshit Guide to Linear Algebra. It's an excellent book on the
       subject that's easy to digest and intended for the more casual
       audience. The last few chapters of the book are dedicated to
       applications of linear algebra like quantum mechanics, probability
       theory, and computer graphics.</p>
    <h3>Quaternions</h3>
    <p>&emsp;Quaternions are complex numbers composed of vector (imaginary) and
       scalar (real) component and are used to represent either a direction
       or point in 3d and 2d space. They are expressed as:</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;<b>v</b>=(x,y,w)</p>
    <p>Where the w component is the real part typically holding the
       value of 0 for a direction and 1 for a position in space. A quaternion
       used in 3d space is then represented as:</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;<b>v</b>=(x,y,z,w)</p>
