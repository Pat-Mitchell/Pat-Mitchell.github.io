    <h2>Linear Algebra</h2>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>&emsp;While reading Prime Obsession: Bernhard Riemann and the Greatest
       Unsolved Problem in Mathematics by John Derbyshire, I noticed that
       quaternions were a frequently mentioned topic and I had
       no prior knowledge of what they were. I could only surmise that
       it was an import topic for mathematics and I wanted to know what
       they were.</p>
    <p>&emsp;A little research led to linear algebra and then Ivan Savov's
       No Bullshit Guide to Linear Algebra. It's an excellent book on the
       subject that's easy to digest and intended for the more casual
       audience. The last few chapters of the book are dedicated to
       applications of linear algebra like quantum mechanics, probability
       theory, and computer graphics.</p>
    <h3>Quaternions</h3>
    <p>&emsp;Quaternions are complex numbers composed of vector (imaginary) and
       scalar (real) component and are used to represent either a direction
       or point in 3d and 2d space. They are expressed as:</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;<b>v</b>=(x,y,w)</p>
    <p>Where the w component is the real part typically holding the
       value of 0 for a direction and 1 for a position in space. A quaternion
       used in 3d space is then represented as:</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;<b>v</b>=(x,y,z,w)</p>
    <h3>Transform Matrices</h3>
    <p>&emsp;A subset of matrices that are extremely helpful form
       for computer graphics because of their ability to combine
       multiple transformations in a single matrix which increases
       readability and execution time of code. Transform matrices
       are 3x3 Matrices for 2d exclusive graphics and 4x4 for 3d
       and appear like so:</p>
    <div class="matRightBracket"></div>
    <div class="matLeftBracket"></div>
    <div class="compGraphicsMatrix">
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>1</td>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>3</td>
          <td>4</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>5</td>
          <td>6</td>
          <td>7</td>
          <td>8</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>9</td>
          <td>10</td>
          <td>11</td>
          <td>12</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>13</td>
          <td>14</td>
          <td>15</td>
          <td>16</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>
    <div class="matRightBracket"></div>
    <div class="matLeftBracket"></div>
    <p>&emsp;In practice, an existing library for matrix creation and
       multiplication is used because the numerous addition and
       multiplication operations used in the linear algebra is
       very tedious and copy-paste error prone since writing out
       each operation is faster than using a generic matrix for loop.</p>
    <p>&emsp;In my case, the book I was using to teach myself WebGL
       was published in 2012 and the available source code was not
       updated for ES6 and contained exclusive use of the "var" keyword,
       which creates the high likelyhood of variable collision.
       To avoid any potential problems, I updated the published
       source code using exclusively the "let" keyword and changed the
       prototypes to classes (ES6 introduced classes, however my
       research leads me to believe that there is virtually no difference
       between the two methods and it's more of a matter of preference)</p>
    <h3>Multiplication</h3>
    <p>&emsp;I'm not actually going to go over matrix multiplication since
       the process iseasily found in both books and online. The important
       thing to note about computer graphics linear algebra is that
       we are mostly multiplying 4x4 matrices by other 4x4 matrices or
       4d vectors</p>
    <p>&emsp;As a result, the library I updated only contains operations
       for combining 4x4 transformation matrices and 4x4 transformation
       matrices transforming quaternions.</p>
    <h3>View Volumes</h3>
    <p>&emsp;Just like multiplication, I'm not going to go into too many
       specifics since the 4x4 matrices fot the two view volumes
       (orthographic and perspective)
       used are easily found in both books and online.</p>
    <p>&emsp;The view volume is the mathematical representation of how
       an eye/camera perceives points in space and represents them
       on a 2d screen. </p>
