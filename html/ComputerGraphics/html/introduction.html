    <h2>Computer Graphics</h2>
    <p>This section acts as a location for personal projects that are centered
    around computer graphics.
    </p>
    <p>Most, if not all, information obtained from this topics was
    obtained through published literature such as Fundamentals of Computer
    Graphics 5th edition; Foundations of Game Engine Development, Volume 1;
    and WebGL Programming Guide.
    </p>
    <p>If possible, live examples will be displayed on the webpage
    using the HTML &#60;canvas&#62; element. Although it is supported
    on mobile devices, I don't recommend viewing examples on them because
    projects were developed on a home computer without consideration for
    the battery life of a smart phone.
