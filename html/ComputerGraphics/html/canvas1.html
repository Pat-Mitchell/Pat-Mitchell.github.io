    <h3>The HTML Canvas</h3>

    </figure>
    <p>&emsp;Above are three examples of how I spent my lunch breaks with
       the &#60;canvas&#62;. The house is drawn using built in tools for
       the canvas's 2d context. The red triangle is drawn using my library's
       fillTriangle method. The cube makes use of my matrix library to
       transform the vertices of a mesh and a z-buffer so triangles are
       drawn correctly.</p>
    <p>&emsp;Originally, I was planning to make a couple 2d games
       for fun. I lost the old files, but I did have snake, breakout,
       and Conway's Game of Life running using only per-pixel rendering
       off of the CPU.</p>
    <p>&emsp;While still using the canvas's basic 2d context,
       I started teaching myself computer graphics and learned to
       display three dimensional models. Transforming each vertex
       in space was relatively easy. I think the hardest part was
       programming the algorithm to draw triangles.</p>
    <p>&emsp;The difficulty of the triangles came with finding a
       good enough algorithm. The Fundamentals of Computer Graphics
       suggested using barycentric coordinates for two naitive solutions.
       The first (and worst) was to pole every pixel on the screen and
       check if they were inside the triangle. The second (and vastly
       improved solution) was to pole only the pixels inside a rectangle
       that bonds the triangle.</p>
    <p>&emsp;I used the second solution for a while until I decided to
       use a DDA (Digital Differential Analysis) solution used in a
       youtuber's windows console game engine. I assumed it was faster
       because it didn't consider pixels outside the triangle. However,
       I moved onto using WebGL before learning how to use the browser's
       built in tools for diagnostics.</p>
