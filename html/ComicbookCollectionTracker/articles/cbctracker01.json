  title:`Comicbook Collection Tracker - Introduction`,
  body:`
  <p>I enjoy collecting individual issues of comics, but it eventually
  becomes necessary to track the comics in my collection. I've accidentally
  bought comics I already own and skipped issues I thought I had. The problem
  is further compounded while buying multiple issues on eBay where I don't
  have complete control of which issues I will get and nature of the limited
  time offers doesn't afford me the greatest luxury.</p>

  <p>I looked online to see if there was any existing software for comic
  collections and they do exist. The issue was that they were paid services
  for something that I was comfortable making a physical list for. Some of
  them even had monthly subscriptions.</p>

  <p>In the end, I decided that making my own software was the better choice.
  I believe this project originally started while I was teaching myself computer
  graphics and I wanted a break from linear algebra and try making a database
  without using SQL or any server because this project was taking place at work
  (during lunch breaks) where I'm not allowed to install non-work related programs.</p>

  <p>Using the work computers created another limitation. The browser would
  refuse to read any local files that aren't javascript, html, or css without
  throwing a CORS error, so the solution for the database is a json file that
  contains all the relevant information a collector would want to see while
  browsing their collection.</p>
